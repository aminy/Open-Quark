@rem Delegate to set-javacp-base.bat for setting up the basic classpath (without adding in either CAL resources or Car-jars)
call set-javacp-base

@rem Do the same with set-javacp-extended.bat if it exists.

@rem Otherwise, add an entry for the debug folder, in order to make the test CAL scripts available.
