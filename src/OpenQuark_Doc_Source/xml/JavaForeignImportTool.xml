    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>This document describes how to use the Java Foreign Import Tool
    (JFit). JFit is a tool that allows Java classes to be imported into CAL
    and used in CAL source development and the Gem Cutter. This allows reuse
    of existing Java code when working with CAL, and eliminates the need for
    costly rewrites of modules that have already been designed and
    tested.</para>
