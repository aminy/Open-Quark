 * This module implements an XML 1.0 parser based on the functions
 * from the <code>Cal.Utilities.Parser</code> library module. The public interface is exposed
 * by the <code>XmlParser</code> module.
 * <p>
 * The layout of this file is closely modeled on the layout of the XML 1.0 specification.
 * With a few exceptions, the productions in the spec have a one-to-one correspondence with
 * parsers defined here. However, all parser names have been converted to camelCase, and
 * sometimes prefixed with xml to avoid name conflicts.
